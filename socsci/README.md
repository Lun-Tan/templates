### General Requirement

Social science at Lun Tan focuses on the effective application of methods and ideas from quantitative fields into our understanding of social phenomena. The stylistic requirement of this submission is not strict, and we expect applicants to demonstrate insights on both quantitative methods and social science, as well as an understanding of why and how the two can be and should be connected. In this section, while we encourage applicants to add math expressions, models, and codes to formulate their ideas, these should be added at discretion and will not replace elaborations on qualitative insights in social science.

Some fields the applicants could consider: computational social science, complex systems science, agent-based models, applications of artificial intelligence in social science, statitics in social science, etc. Novel fields and ideas are always welcomed. 

The submission should consists of two sections: Past Experience and Research Interests. The Past Experience should be used to elaborate any relevant experience you have that demonstrate your interest and understanding in social science, quantitative fields, and Luntan in general. This includes but is not limited to books/articles, research experience, extracurricular activities, etc. The Reserach Interests section should be used to specify your interests in one or more topics in social sciences. You could write a research plan on a social event/pheonmenon, with abstract, hypothesis, and method. You could also use this section to explore more theoretical topics in social science.
