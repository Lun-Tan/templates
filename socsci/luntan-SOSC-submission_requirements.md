### General Requirement

The Social science track focuses on the effective application of methods and ideas from quantitative fields on social phenomena. Compared with other tracks, submission to social science track could be freer in form, and we evaluate applications on the insight on social issues and rigor of quantitative methods, as well as the effective and creative connection between the two. In this section, while we encourage, but do not require, applicants to add math expressions, models, and codes to formulate their ideas, these should be added at discretion and will not replace elaborations on qualitative insights in social science.

Some fields the applicants could consider: computational social science, complex systems science, agent-based models, applications of artificial intelligence in social science, statitics in social science, etc. Novel fields and ideas are always welcomed.

The submission should consists of two sections: Past Experience and Research Interests. The Past Experience section should be used to elaborate any relevant experience applicants have that could demonstrate their interest and knowledge in social science, quantitative methods, and Luntan in general. This includes but is not limited to books/articles, research experience, extracurricular activities, etc. The Reserach Interests section should be used to specify interests in one or more topics in social sciences. You could write a research plan on a social event/pheonmenon, with abstract, hypothesis, and method, or you could explore more theoretical topics in social science.
